Phiz includes an app that enables you to receive data from the Phiz website.
Review the [documentation](https://www.phizmocap.dev/docs) to learn how to use the website.

## Download the App
Download and install the app for your platform [here](https://www.phizmocap.dev/downloads).

Phiz is a free open-source project without funding.
**Due to the lack of a paid yearly developer license, the app will not be signed, and your OS will display a warning.**
You can still run the app by following the instructions below.

## Windows
After downloading the app, your browser may display a warning. Simply keep the file.

When you click on the app installer, Windows will show another warning. Click on `More info` and `Run anyway`.

To resolve this, go to `System Preferences` -> `Security & Privacy` -> `General` and click on `Open Anyway`. Then, install the app.

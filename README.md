This project will be unavailable soon due to [mocap4face by alter](https://github.com/facemoji/mocap4face)'s sudden termination of their service.

Working on finding an alternative solution at the moment. Any help is appreciated.

## FAQs
### I clicked download but nothing is downloaded. Help.
**Are you using iPhone or iPad?** If so, try using a different browser (Safari should work most of the time). And then also check your download folder. If it's still not working, **please open an issue on this page.** 

### I can't import the glb file into Maya/Unreal/Unity. Help.
Even though as awesome as the file format is, glb/gltf file is still not widely supported by professional tools. The best workflow currently is to convert the file to fbx file format in Blender. **Please don't import glb and export fbx directly while using Blender. Shape keys animations require extra steps to export into fbx file format.** I will create a tutorial in the future but right please read [this awesome tutorial](https://continuebreak.com/articles/how-blender-shape-key-ue4-morph-target-animations/)

### How do I quickly view my animation to check if it works or not?
Import it into Blender or any [gltf viewer](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/)

### I wish this function also exist so my life is ultimately better.
Open a new issue :) I'd gladly implement more things.
